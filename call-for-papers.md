# Call for Participation
## Synthetic Data: Representation and/vs Representativeness

Full-day, onsite workshop at [Aarhus 2025 Computing [X] Crisis Conference](https://synthetic-data-workshop.github.io/)

Organized by:
- Hannah Devinney (_Linköping University_)
- Katherine Harrison (_Linköping University_)
- Vagrant Gautam (_Saarland University_)
- Irina Shklovski (_University of Copenhagen_, _Linköping University_)

Synthetic data promises to address three key concerns for data-driven technologies: sparsity, privacy, and bias or lack of diversity.
This workshop will interrogate the promise of creating better, more diverse, more representative datasets, by critically examining how data are understood to be "representative" in different senses, for example, statistically, through stereotype, or more qualitative and individual depictions of identity and other qualities.

We invite participation from anyone interested in the broad questions of what it means to "represent" things and people in data.
To ground the event across our various disciplines and practices, we ask you to submit a short (1-2 page) position statement on the topic of data "representation" in your context.

Accepted submissions will be shared with all participants via the workshop website before the event, allowing participants to introduce themselves to each other and for asynchronous discussions of their position papers and virtual network building from the start.
