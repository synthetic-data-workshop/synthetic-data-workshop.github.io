# Schedule

The workshop will take place on August 18th, 2025, from 9 am to 5 pm (including lunch and two coffee breaks).
Rather than a traditional workshop with presentations, we are planning to facilitate conversations between participants across disciplines, and the synthesis of ideas in groups.
To prepare for these discussions, we will share the position statements we received with all participants by early August, so that everyone has read them by the day of the workshop.
We will also finalize and post the exact schedule by early August, with detailed time breakdowns for people who will join virtually.
