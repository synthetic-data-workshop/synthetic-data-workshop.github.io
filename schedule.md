# Schedule

The workshop will take place on August 18th, 2025, from 9 am to 5 pm (including lunch and two coffee breaks).
Rather than a traditional workshop with presentations, we are planning to facilitate conversations between participants across disciplines, and the synthesis of ideas in groups.
To prepare for these discussions, we have released all the [position statements](/papers) we accepted, so that everyone has a chance to read them before the workshop.
We will finalize and post further instructions and the exact schedule by early August, with detailed time breakdowns for people who will join virtually.
